# exp-python-Tkinter-
several experience of Tk interfaces 

It's my daily coding to get used to build python interfaces. 

Codes are usable with python3.6 ~.

But I don't assure you that codes are working correctly.

# Caution
Some documents use a code that "import Tkinter" to import Tk interface modules.

But it didn't work.

It should be fixed "import tkinter".

Have to use lowercase of 'T'.
